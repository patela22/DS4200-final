      <h2>Topics, Tasks, and Goals</h2>
      <p>
        Finding quality professors is essential for a positive college
        experience, particularly at large institutions like Northeastern
        University. Our research objective aims to identify which colleges and
        departments within Northeastern have the best-rated professors,
        utilizing data from Rate My Professor. Specifically, our research
        question focuses on understanding the distribution of average professor
        ratings across various departments. By analyzing subjective rating data,
        we intend to provide valuable insights that can assist students in
        making informed decisions when selecting courses. Additionally, this
        analysis will offer the university a comprehensive view of teaching
        quality across its colleges, pinpointing areas of strength and
        opportunities for improvement.

      <h2>Data</h2>
      <p>
        We began by collecting essential information about professors,
        specifically their names and IDs. Utilizing an available API, we
        retrieved this foundational data, serving as a gateway to enhancing our
        dataset. With the IDs, we then proceeded to scrape additional
        information, gathering a comprehensive array of details such as
        department affiliations, college names, ratings, levels of difficulty,
        and reviews. Once we amassed this dataset, which consisted of 3,494 rows
        and 15 columns, we undertook an essential preprocessing phase. This step
        involved cleaning the data to ensure its quality and reliability. We
        focused on identifying and addressing NaN values, duplicates, and any
        inconsistencies that could compromise our analysis. This careful setup
        laid the groundwork for creating visual representations that could help
        explain the complexities of professor ratings across various departments
        and colleges.

      <h2>
        Distribution of Average Rating of Professors among different colleges
      </h2>
      <div id="vis-histogram"></div>
      <p>
        The histogram above shows the distribution of average ratings for
        professors in different Northeastern Colleges. The user can interact
        with the chart by choosing the college of their choice with the drop
        down selector, and the histograms will update to reflect the user input.
        We can see a common pattern in the distribution of ratings for CSSH,
        Bouve College, CAMD, COS, and CPS. These colleges have a solid
        incremental up trend in their ratings, where as the ratings go up, so
        does the number of professors. COE and DMSB also have a generally more
        skewed right distribution, but it is not as evident the previously
        mentioned colleges. Khoury has the most mixed distribution compared to
        all colleges at Northeastern, with their ratings distributed in the 2.0
        to 5.0 range. Overall, the main takaway from these histograms is that
        colleges who are more skewed right have a general tendency to have more
        professors that are liked by its students and that Northeastern
        generally has professors that have high ratings of 4 or above and the
        highests frequency for all colleges are professors with a rating of 4.5
        to 5. This can help guide students when debating in which college(s)
        they want to study in, given that higher ratings are favoured.

      <h2>Popular Tag Frequency for Different Professors</h2>
      <div id="vis-chart"></div>
      <p>
        The dataset consists of information about tag frequencies for different
        colleges and departments at Northeastern University. It is visualized in
        an interactive bar chart, where attributes include "Popular Tags,"
        "NEU_Colleges," "Department," and "Count," representing the frequency of
        each tag. The data highlights patterns such as how frequently certain
        tags like "Accessible outside class" or "Amazing lectures" are
        associated with specific departments across colleges. The interactive
        nature allows filtering by college, enabling detailed insights into the
        distribution of tags, making it useful for analyzing academic
        experiences or course characteristics.

      <h2>Interactive Histogram of Metric Distribution by Different Majors</h2>
      <div id="vis-interactive-histogram"></div>
      <p>
        The interactive histograms in this chart were designed to visually
        represent the distribution of metrics, such as average ratings or
        difficulty levels, across various colleges and departments at
        Northeastern University. Each histogram allows users to observe the
        frequency of specific metric values, making it easy to identify trends,
        outliers, or patterns within the data. The interactivity is enhanced by
        dropdown menus, enabling users to filter by college and metric for a
        more customized view. Tooltips add depth to the analysis by providing
        detailed information for each bar when hovered over, such as the college
        name, metric type, and corresponding value. The overall design is large
        and centrally aligned to ensure clarity and prominence, making the data
        accessible and easy to explore for meaningful insights.

        Scatterplot Plot Relation with Average Professor Rating and Course
        Difficulty
      </h2>
      <img class="chart-img" src="graphs/scatterplot_facets.png" />
      <p>
        Students across universities may be under the belief that the more
        difficult a course is, the more likely that professor will have a lower
        rating. However, from the scatterplots above, which depicts the
        relationship between Average Rating and Level of Difficulty for
        professors across Northeastern colleges, we can see the correlations are
        all somewhat negative, but not to the extent one may expect. For most
        colleges we see fairly mild negative correlations, ranging from -0.37 to
        -0.52, which cannot concretely denote that higher levels of difficulties
        correlate with lower average ratings. The only expectations are for
        Bouve and Khoury, which respectively have -0.67 and -0.20 correlations.
        Overall, these scatterplots show that we can fairly confident that
        levels of difficulty do not indicate lower average ratings as the plot
        depict a negligible correlation and an even poorer R^2, showing that the
        linear regression model does not encapsulate the data well. This
        highlights that for a majority of colleges at NEU, students should not
        necessarily be biased towards certain professors simply because of the
        difficulty of the course and that a higher rating does not necessarily
        signify that a professor is teaching an easier course.

      <h2>
        Sentiment Score vs Average Rating for Professors from Northeastern
        Colleges (5+ Ratings)
      </h2>
      <div id="scatterplot-individual" class="chart"></div>
      <p>
        Our college professor scatter plot displays the relationship between
        sentiment scores and average ratings for professors across different
        colleges at Northeastern University. Each point represents a professor
        with at least 5 ratings, color-coded by their respective college. There
        is a strong positive correlation between sentiment scores and average
        ratings. This trend suggests that professors with a more positive
        sentiment in their reviews generally receive higher average ratings.
        Most ratings range between 2.0 and 4.5, while sentiment scores range
        from around -0.10 to 0.40. A few outliers with lower ratings (~1.5) and
        sentiment scores (< 0.00) suggest some professors receive consistently
        negative feedback. Professors from all colleges are spread across the
        entire range, indicating that no single college lies in a specific
        sentiment score or rating range. Bouve College of Health Sciences seemed
        to perform as the best college, clustering in the higher sentiment and
        rating ranges.

      <h2>
        Boxplot of Average Ratings for Professors from Different Northeastern
        colleges
      </h2>
      <img class="chart-img" src="graphs/box_plot.png" />
      <p>
        The boxplots above highlight the distribution of average ratings for
        professors at Northeastern's colleges. As we can see, a vast majority of
        colleges seem to have approximately equal distributions, this is most
        evident in the first five boxplots (from DMSB to CAMD), where the IQR
        lies in between 3.0 and 4.5, and the median lies at approximately 3.7.
        However, we do so see some slight differences for the last 3 colleges.
        Khoury and the COS have more spread out distributions (as shown by their
        wider IQRs) that are centered at lower medians (approximately 3.4 for
        Khoury and 3.5 for COS). On the other hand, CPS has a more concentrated
        distribution, highlighted by its smaller IQR and shorter tails, with a
        median that is higher than the rest of Northeastern colleges, although
        only by a small margin, laying right below the 4.0 level. Overall, the
        main takeaway from these histograms is that average ratings for
        Northeastern professors lay on the upper half of the 1-5 average rating
        scale on Rate My Professor. Of course, these distributions do not
        exemplify a "ranking" of Northeastern colleges but, it most definitely
        can help guide students in seeing how professor ratings are distributed
        when aggregated, which can have an influence on what they decide to
        study.

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Our analysis of Northeastern University's Rate My Professor data offers
        insights into the distribution of professor ratings across various
        colleges and departments. A primary finding is the generally positive
        distribution of professor ratings across Northeastern, with most
        colleges having a significant proportion of professors rated between 4.0
        and 5.0. Colleges such as Bouve College of Health Sciences, the College
        of Social Sciences and Humanities, and the College of Science exhibited
        right-skewed distributions, indicating a higher frequency of well-rated
        professors. Conversely, Khoury College of Computer Sciences displayed a
        more mixed distribution, suggesting higher variability in student
        experiences. Our sentiment analysis further reinforced this trend,
        showing a strong positive correlation between sentiment scores and
        average ratings. Professors who receive more favorable reviews tend to
        have higher overall ratings, with Bouve College standing out for its
        consistently high sentiment and rating scores. On the other hand, Khoury
        and the School of Law had lower average ratings and sentiment scores,
        suggesting areas where student satisfaction may be lower or more
        variable. Interestingly, the relationship between a professor's rating
        and the perceived difficulty of their course was not as straightforward
        as one might assume. While there were mild negative correlations across
        most colleges, they were not strong enough to conclusively link higher
        difficulty with lower ratings. This information can benefit students
        seeking specific learning environments or teaching methods. Overall, our
        research provides a comprehensive overview of teaching quality across
        Northeastern University. Most colleges feature highly rated professors,
        and while course difficulty plays a role in student evaluations, it is
        not the sole determinant of a professor's rating. These insights can
        help students choose professors and courses that align with their
        academic goals and learning preferences while offering the university a
        data-driven perspective on areas of strength and opportunities for
        improvement.
