    <h1>Analyzing Northeastern Rate My Professor Data</h1>
    <h3>By: Paul Champagne, Trung Nguyen, Ansh Patel, & Owen Sharpe</h3>

    <div class="chart-container">
      <h2>Topics, Tasks, and Goals</h2>
      <p>
        Our research question stated, "Which colleges/departments in
        Northeastern University have the best-rated professors, and how does the
        distribution of average ratings vary across these departments?"
      </p>

      <p>
        Our main goal was to observe the differences in subjective ability
        between the professors at Northeastern University. We used subjective
        scoring data through RateMyProfessor to draw insights into which
        Northeastern colleges perform better than others.
      </p>

      <p>
        We wanted to give students helpful information to make better choices
        when picking their classes. Additionally, this analysis can provide the
        university with a clearer picture of teaching quality across its
        colleges, showing where things are going well and where there might be
        room for improvement.

      <h2>Data</h2>
      <p>
        The initial scraped dataset consisted of 3494 rows and 15 columns, with
        various numerical and categorical features such as professor name,
        department, college, rating, level of difficulty, reviews, and several
        others.
      </p>

      <p>
        We collected the data partly by scraping the RateMyProfessor website,
        with some help from an available API.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once the data was collected, we preprocessed certain columns and rows to
        deal with NaN values and other issues, so the data could be ready for
        visualization.

    <div class="chart-container">
      <h2>Graph 1</h2>
      <div id="vis-chart"></div>
      <p>
        The dataset consists of information about tag frequencies for different
        colleges and departments at Northeastern University. It is visualized in
        an interactive bar chart, where attributes include "Popular Tags,"
        "NEU_Colleges," "Department," and "Count," representing the frequency of
        each tag. The data highlights patterns such as how frequently certain
        tags like "Accessible outside class" or "Amazing lectures" are
        associated with specific departments across colleges. The interactive
        nature allows filtering by college, enabling detailed insights into the
        distribution of tags, making it useful for analyzing academic
        experiences or course characteristics.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="chart-container">
      <h2>Graph 2</h2>
      <div id="vis-heatmap"></div>
      <p>
        The dataset explores ratings and metrics across various colleges and
        departments at Northeastern University, focusing on attributes like
        average ratings, number of ratings, and difficulty levels. It is
        structured as an interactive heatmap, where rows represent colleges and
        columns represent departments, with values encoded in color. The data
        includes hundreds of entries, sourced from academic evaluations or
        surveys, and allows users to filter by specific colleges or metrics for
        a customized view. This comprehensive structure is designed to offer
        insights into educational quality and performance trends across
        departments.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="chart-container">
      <h2>Graph 3</h2>
      <div id="vis-histogram"></div>
      <p>
        The histogram above shows the distribution of average ratings for
        professors in different Northeastern Colleges. The user can interact
        with the chart by choosing the college of their choice with the drop
        down selector, and the histograms will update to reflect the user input.
        We can see a common pattern in the distribution of ratings for CSSH,
        Bouve College, CAMD, COS, and CPS. These colleges have a solid
        incremental up trend in their ratings, where as the ratings go up, so
        does the number of professors. COE and DMSB also have a generally more
        skewed right distribution, but it is not as evident the previously
        mentioned colleges. Khoury has the most mixed distribution compared to
        all colleges at Northeastern, with their ratings distributed in the 2.0
        to 5.0 range. Overall, the main takaway from these histograms is that
        colleges who are more skewed right have a general tendency to have more
        professors that are liked by its students and that Northeastern
        generally has professors that have high ratings of 4 or above and the
        highests frequency for all colleges are professors with a rating of 4.5
        to 5. This can help guide students when debating in which college(s)
        they want to study in, given that higher ratings are favoured.

      <p>
        Students across universities may be under the belief that the more
        difficult a course is, the more likely that professor will have a lower
        rating. However, from the scatterplots above, which depicts the
        relationship between Average Rating and Level of Difficulty for
        professors across Northeastern colleges, we can see the correlations are
        all somewhat negative, but not to the extent one may expect. For most
        colleges we see fairly mild negative correlations, ranging from -0.37 to
        -0.52, which cannot concretely denote that higher levels of difficulties
        correlate with lower average ratings. The only expections are for Bouve
        and Khoury, which respectively have a -0.67 and -0.20 correlation. From
        these, we can be more confident that levels of difficulty do lead to
        lower average ratings for the former, while there is a negligible
        correlation for the latter. Overall, this goes to show that for a
        majority of colleges at NEU, students should not necessarily be biased
        towards certain professors simply because of the difficulty of the
        course and that, one the hand, a higher rating does not necessarily
        signify that a professor is teaching an easier course.
