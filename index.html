    <h1>Analyzing Northeastern Rate My Professor Data</h1>

      <h2>Topics, Tasks, and Goals</h2>
      <p>
        Finding quality professors is essential for a positive college
        experience, particularly at large institutions like Northeastern
        University. Our research objective aims to identify which colleges and
        departments within Northeastern have the best-rated professors,
        utilizing data from Rate My Professor. Specifically, our research
        question focuses on understanding the distribution of average professor
        ratings across various departments. By analyzing subjective rating data,
        we intend to provide valuable insights that can assist students in
        making informed decisions when selecting courses. Additionally, this
        analysis will offer the university a comprehensive view of teaching
        quality across its colleges, pinpointing areas of strength and
        opportunities for improvement.

      <h2>Data</h2>
      <p>
        We began by collecting essential information about professors,
        specifically their names and IDs. Utilizing an available API, we
        retrieved this foundational data, serving as a gateway to enhancing our
        dataset. With the IDs, we then proceeded to scrape additional
        information, gathering a comprehensive array of details such as
        department affiliations, college names, ratings, levels of difficulty,
        and reviews. Once we amassed this dataset, which consisted of 3,494 rows
        and 15 columns, we undertook an essential preprocessing phase. This step
        involved cleaning the data to ensure its quality and reliability. We
        focused on identifying and addressing NaN values, duplicates, and any
        inconsistencies that could compromise our analysis. This careful setup
        laid the groundwork for creating visual representations that could help
        explain the complexities of professor ratings across various departments
        and colleges.

      <div id="vis-chart"></div>
      <p>
        The dataset consists of information about tag frequencies for different
        colleges and departments at Northeastern University. It is visualized in
        an interactive bar chart, where attributes include "Popular Tags,"
        "NEU_Colleges," "Department," and "Count," representing the frequency of
        each tag. The data highlights patterns such as how frequently certain
        tags like "Accessible outside class" or "Amazing lectures" are
        associated with specific departments across colleges. The interactive
        nature allows filtering by college, enabling detailed insights into the
        distribution of tags, making it useful for analyzing academic
        experiences or course characteristics.

      <h2>Graph 2</h2>
      <div id="vis-heatmap"></div>
      <p>
        The dataset explores ratings and metrics across various colleges and
        departments at Northeastern University, focusing on attributes like
        average ratings, number of ratings, and difficulty levels. It is
        structured as an interactive heatmap, where rows represent colleges and
        columns represent departments, with values encoded in color. The data
        includes hundreds of entries, sourced from academic evaluations or
        surveys, and allows users to filter by specific colleges or metrics for
        a customized view. This comprehensive structure is designed to offer
        insights into educational quality and performance trends across
        departments.

      <h2>Graph 3</h2>
      <div id="vis-histogram"></div>
      <p>
        The histogram above shows the distribution of average ratings for
        professors in different Northeastern Colleges. The user can interact
        with the chart by choosing the college of their choice with the drop
        down selector, and the histograms will update to reflect the user input.
        We can see a common pattern in the distribution of ratings for CSSH,
        Bouve College, CAMD, COS, and CPS. These colleges have a solid
        incremental up trend in their ratings, where as the ratings go up, so
        does the number of professors. COE and DMSB also have a generally more
        skewed right distribution, but it is not as evident the previously
        mentioned colleges. Khoury has the most mixed distribution compared to
        all colleges at Northeastern, with their ratings distributed in the 2.0
        to 5.0 range. Overall, the main takaway from these histograms is that
        colleges who are more skewed right have a general tendency to have more
        professors that are liked by its students and that Northeastern
        generally has professors that have high ratings of 4 or above and the
        highests frequency for all colleges are professors with a rating of 4.5
        to 5. This can help guide students when debating in which college(s)
        they want to study in, given that higher ratings are favoured.

      <p>
        Students across universities may be under the belief that the more
        difficult a course is, the more likely that professor will have a lower
        rating. However, from the scatterplots above, which depicts the
        relationship between Average Rating and Level of Difficulty for
        professors across Northeastern colleges, we can see the correlations are
        all somewhat negative, but not to the extent one may expect. For most
        colleges we see fairly mild negative correlations, ranging from -0.37 to
        -0.52, which cannot concretely denote that higher levels of difficulties
        correlate with lower average ratings. The only expections are for Bouve
        and Khoury, which respectively have a -0.67 and -0.20 correlation. From
        these, we can be more confident that levels of difficulty do lead to
        lower average ratings for the former, while there is a negligible
        correlation for the latter. Overall, this goes to show that for a
        majority of colleges at NEU, students should not necessarily be biased
        towards certain professors simply because of the difficulty of the
        course and that, one the hand, a higher rating does not necessarily
        signify that a professor is teaching an easier course.

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Our analysis of Northeastern University's RateMyProfessor data has
        provided valuable insights into the distribution of average ratings
        across different colleges and departments. By visualizing the data
        through interactive graphs, we were able to identify patterns and trends
        that can help students make informed decisions when selecting courses
        and professors. The data showed that colleges like CSSH, Bouve College,
        CAMD, COS, and CPS have a higher number of professors with better
        ratings, while colleges like COE and DMSB have a more skewed
        distribution. The scatterplots also revealed that the correlation
        between average ratings and level of difficulty is not as strong as
        expected, with most colleges showing mild negative correlations. The
        sentiment analysis further highlighted the relationship between
        sentiment scores and average ratings, providing a more nuanced view of
        professor performance. Overall, our analysis has shed light on the
        teaching quality at Northeastern University and can be used to guide
        students in their academic choices.
